# Winged Wonders: A Deep Learning Approach to Butterfly Species Identification 🦋🌿

> Are you fascinated by the beautiful world of butterflies? 🦋 With over 20,000 known species, these delicate creatures have long been a subject of interest for entomologists and naturalists alike. However, accurate identification of butterfly species remains a significant challenge, hindering our understanding of their behavior, habitat, and conservation. 🌿

## `About`
This project is all about using deep learning to classify images of butterflies into their respective species. The dataset is from Kaggle, which contains over 10,000 images of butterflies from 100 different species. 📸
The images were collected from various sources, including field observations, museum collections, and online repositories.


| Category | Number of Images |
| --- | --- |
| Training | 8,000 |
| Validation | 1,000 |
| Testing | 1,000 |

## `The Problem` 🤔

* Manual identification of butterfly species is a time-consuming and expertise-dependent process, prone to errors and inconsistencies. 📝
* The lack of an efficient and accurate identification system hinders the study of butterfly populations, habitats, and behavior, ultimately affecting conservation efforts. 🌎

===============================================================================
## `Methodology` 🔍
### Data Preprocessing 🔀

* Data augmentation: Apply random transformations to the images to artificially increase the size of the training set using TF-keras pre-processing layers. 🔀
* Image resizing: Resize images to a uniform size of 224x224 pixels.

### Model Architecture 📚

* Base model: MobileNetV3Large model pre-trained on ImageNet
* Custom classification head: Add a new classification head on top of the base model, consisting of global average pooling layers, batch normalization layers, and dense layers with 100 units.

### Training 📊

* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss function: Sparse categorical cross-entropy
* Batch size: 32
* Number of epochs: 50


### Model Performance 📊

The model achieves a test accuracy of 0.96, which is a great result considering the complexity of the dataset! 🎉 Here's a breakdown of the results:

* Training accuracy: 0.9996
* Validation accuracy: 0.9420
* Test accuracy: 0.9600

### Future Work 🚀

* Experiment with different model architectures (ResNet or DenseNet 🤖) and hyperparameters (transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a different dataset 📚) to improve performance.
