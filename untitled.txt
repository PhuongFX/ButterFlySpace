Objectives:

    Develop a Deep Learning model for classifying butterfly images into their respective species using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
    Implement a feature extraction algorithm to enhance classification accuracy and robustness.
    Achieve high accuracy in species identification, paving the way for future innovations in entomology, ecology, and conservation.


Implementation

The implementation of the methodology can be seen in the code. The training and testing directories are created, and the images are split between them. The dataset is then loaded into a dataframe. Next, the training data is augmented and fed into the MobileNetV3 architecture. The results from the model are then evaluated and compared.

The MobileNetV3 model is then trained with the best hyperparameters found using a random search. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using a classification report and a confusion matrix. Predictions are made on a random sample of images, and incorrect predictions are identified and visualized.

Note that I've removed the fine-tuning step, as it was specific to the InceptionV3 model in the original text. If you're fine-tuning your MobileNetV3 model, you can add that step back in.
